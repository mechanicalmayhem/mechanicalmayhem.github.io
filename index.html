            <p>Hi, welcome to my little corner of the web.  My name is Ross Brutsman, and I am very interested in learning Full Stack development amongst other things.  I have worked very hard to build a career in engineering, mainly Process Engineering.  Throughout my career, I have developed several software products to aid in that end.  My most notable accomplishment is a proprietary package I built to gather, analzye, and store several aspects of a manufacturing process in the pharmaceutical industry.  </p>
            <p>Other passions of mine include flying, motorcycling, land speed records, etc.  I hope to eventually document many of those projects on the web, as well as use this as a living C.V.  I do not prefer to share my email address, but if you would like to contact me professionally, please use <a href='www.linkedin.com/in/rossbrutsman'>linkedIn</a>.  As well, a limited selection of publicly available code can be found on my <a href='www.github.com/mechanicalmayhem'>GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>Thanks again!</p>
