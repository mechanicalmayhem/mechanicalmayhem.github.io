  <li><h2>Pacmen Exercise </h2><a href='/pacmen/'>(html link)</a> (html) / <a href='https://github.com/mechanicalmayhem/pacmen'>(github repository)</a>
  <br />
  <p>In this exercise we demonstrate control of the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. Objects (PacMen) are added and updated on the screen to appear to be moving. This is accomplished using JavaScript to modify the DOM in real-time.
By clicking the 'Add PacMan' button, a new PacMan will be added to the screen. Clicking the 'Start Game' button will start them all moving on random trajectories as well as bouncing them off the browser walls. Enjoy!</p></li>

  <br />
  <p>In this exercise we demonstrate control of the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. Objects (eye pupils) appear to follow the mouse position. We accomplish this by rapidly updating the position of the pupils whenever the browser detects mouse movement through the use of the '.onmousemove' JavaScript function. There is nothing to click here, only moving eyeballs...enjoy!</p></li>
  <li><a href='/realTimeBus/'>Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise</a> (html) - <a href='https://github.com/mechanicalmayhem/realTimeBus'>Real Time Bus Tracker Github Repository</a>
  <br />
  <p>In this exercise we demontsrate several things. The map is generated using the mapbox API. Using a recursively called function, we cycle the markers through an array of cordinates that represent all the bus stops between MIT and Harvard when the button labeled 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard' is clicked. Along with utilizing an API, JavaScripts's 'setTimeout' function is used to perform the recursive call.</p></li>
